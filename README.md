Mantra of data analytics today is “No coding, Low coding”. After Python and R, it is well proven that you need not be a developer for analyzing the data. From the day Lambda function was introduced in Excel, I tried to learn about the programming abilities of this function along with other array functions.

This Excel Audit Tool template is collection of 100+ wide range of functions related to financial analysis, statistics, data manipulation, and other Excel operations. I have started this as a hobby project.

When searching for some algorithms and solutions, I have come across various online resources and contributors who have generously shared the algorithms and knowledge related to the functions listed. These resources have been instrumental in the development of these functions, and they have played a significant role in enhancing their utility in various domains, including finance, auditing, data analysis, and more.

The collective wisdom and expertise of the online community have been invaluable that serve both personal and professional purposes. The willingness of individuals and organizations to share their insights and solutions has been instrumental in broadening the scope and capabilities of these functions.

I have named this tool 'Be Indian' because some of these functions are created within the context of the Indian environment. Furthermore, I have used this name since 2000 for my Excel add-in, which was designed to spell Indian numbers and format numbers using the Indian method of commas.

This template is and will be 100% free and it certainly comes with no warranties or guarantees!

If you use this template you are most welcome to give suggestions/comments/critics/ideas for further improvement.

I extend my thanks to the countless individuals, forums, websites, and open-source communities who have contributed to the development of these algorithms. Their dedication to knowledge sharing has enriched me in this learning and development process.
